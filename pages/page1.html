            <p class = "paragraph">Ender was born at the end of the Third Formic War. The Formics, also called "Buggers" in <i>Ender's Game</i>, are an ant-like alien civilization, comprised of the Hive Queen and drones. During Ender's childhood, the Formics were seen as the number 1 enemies of the whole Human Race. Being a master strategist, Ender naturally found a strong interest in the Buggers. In Battle School he would watch endless hours of footage taken during the first Bugger War searching for patterns in the way the Formics would fight in the Second Formic War. At the end of the Third Formic War, Ender's interest in the Buggers took an entire 180 turn. He was no longer interested in defeating them, but instead interested in saving them by finding the a home for their last remnant, the new Hive Queen.</p>

The Pequiniños, also called the Piggies, where small sort of pig-like humaoids who dwelt on the Portuguese settled planet of Lusitania. On their planet also came a new deadly virus that almost killed all human inhabitants. To stop the virus from spreading across the galaxy, other humans were ready to destroy Lusitania along with the Piggies. In the last books of the series, Ender, his wife Novinha, and her children are hard pressed to find a cure for the virus meanwhile stop the other humans from destroying Lusitania and recomming mass xenocide. </p>

            <p class = "subtitle">Strategy</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">When Earth needed a master strategist to defeat the Buggers, the world's government set Ender's parents up hoping that they could produce a child that would lead the human race in the Third Formic War. Ender's parents had three children total: Ender's older brother Peter who was the oldest, Ender's older sister Valentine, and then Ender. Both Peter and Valentined were monitored until age 6 to see if they could be the one whom the government wanted to lead the invasion on the Bugger's home world. Both Peter and Valentine failed however for having either a too cruel or too nice of a personality. Ender was the exception. Either at school or later in the Battle room, Ender will showcase is natural skills in strategy. He easily adapted to new situation were other students would fail and spent of his own time studying vids from the Second Formic war to learn strategy from the enemy.</p>

        <div class="row paragraph">
            <p class = "subtitle">Philosophy</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">Throughout the Enderverse novels, Ender displays his great interest in philosophy. Ender takes the teaching to love thy enemy to whole new greater level than the average person. In order to defeat his enemy, he will learn so much about them to the point where he cannot help but to love them. It is the philosophy of Ender that it is impossible to truly understand another person and not be able to love them. Ender will both love his enemy and destroy them however. In a fight he had with his school bully, Stinson, after knocking Stinson to the ground winning the battle, he then repeatedly kicked Stinson in the face in order to show Stinsons friends what would happen to them if they ever try to fight Ender again. Ender commented that knocking Stinson to the ground won the battle of that day, but what he did afterwards won all battles afterwards. After the Third Formic war however, Ender's philosophy changes a little. Were as before he had an "ends justify the means" ideology, he realizes that he regrets the means he took to get the ends which at the time he believed to be just, and so he converts to an "ends do not justify the means" ideology. The prime example in the book series of this conversion is with the War with the Buggers. Ender lead the fight against the Buggers because he believed he had to defend the humans from any future Bugger invasion, however, unknown to Ender or any human living, the Bugger's had no intention of attacking the humans again and wanted to live in peace.</p>
