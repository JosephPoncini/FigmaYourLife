            <p class = "paragraph">After having a monitor on his neck for 4 years, Ender Wiggin was taken into Battle School at age six. He passed the tests, which his brother and sister were not able, and was admitted a few years younger than what was typical for most Battle School students.</p>

            <p class = "paragraph">Ender was admitted into a Battle School army at a younger age than anyone else before him. He faced great adversity for this among the other student especially from his first commander Bonzo of Salamander Army. Despite all this, Ender in a few years rose through all the ranks and lead the leaderboards in Battle Room game. He was made captain of the Dragon Army, at the young age of 9, and his army would go undefeated, even when in the Battle Room, the teachers would set two armies against his one.  </p>

            <p class = "subtitle">Victory over the Formics</p>
            <p class = "paragraph"><b>Do not read this if you do not want the end of Ender's Game Spoiled.</b> After graduating from Battle School, Ender was promoted to Command School. He was instructed under the legendary war hero, General Mazer Rackham. In battle school he would train on a device known as the "simulator". On the simulator, Ender would command human space vessel in a space battle against the Buggers. Ender believed all of this to be just a simulation, but it wasn't. For Ender's "last test" he was given an impossible situaion, he was fighting the Bugger's homeworld and was greatly outnumbered. Despite this, in hopes that the teachers would expel him afterwards, he created a formation that would drive a hole through the Bugger's ships and create an opening for Ender to blast the planet with the M.D. device. The M.D. device scrambles the molecules of the object it shoots, the bigger the object, the bigger the explosion. Ender knew this and so when he shot the planet he knew it would take all the Buggers along with his fleet. What he did not know was that all this was real and by doing what he did, he won the Third Formic War for the humans.</p>

            <p class = "subtitle">Bringing Peace to Lusitania</p>
            <p class = "paragraph">In Ender's later years he would find a home for the new Hive Queen on the planet Lusitania. Lusitania became the first planet to home three different types of sentient life forms: humans, Formics, and the Pequiniños. Lusitania however has on it a deadly virus which only thanks to some heroic medical researchers who came before Ender, the people on Lusitania were able to be immune to by eating the genetically altered crops on that planet. Out of fear of the virus spreading to other planets however, the new intergalactic fleet had plans to destroy Lusitania along with all lifeforms on it. Ender along with his wife Novinha, and her children, would find a way however to destroy the virus once and for all and convince the intergalactic fleet to not destroy the Pequiniños homeworld.</p>
