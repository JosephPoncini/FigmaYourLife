// Peer Review Comments: Ashur Nanno: the web page look very neet and clean styling; color's choices were good. The navbar and icon looks well and buttons works as they should be.  The only things I found is that the main page title size doesn't match the Figma original design; and the width in page looks good better than the Figma but are not the same.
